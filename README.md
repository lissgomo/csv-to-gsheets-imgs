## Use Gsheets to import CSV file to view first vehicle image

## **PURPOSE**
#### Review first image of incoming inventory from a third-party to ensure no overlays. This is easier than copying an pasting every link manually to review every first image on the inbound file. It also helps so we don't double overlay the images since we apply seperate overlays created by our design team.

#### Only did it for the first image of every vehicle for loading time and since Dealerships primarily use overlays on the first image as an industry standard.

## **DEFAULTS**
#### Default file name for inventory file: default-inventory.csv
#### Must contain the following headers: 'Dealer ID', 'Stock Number', 'VIN', 'Images'
