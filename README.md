## Use Gsheets to import CSV file to view first vehicle image

## **PURPOSE**
#### Review first image of incoming inventory to ensure no overlays. Easier than copying an pasting every link manually to review every first image on the inbound file.
#### Only did it for the first image of every vehicle for loading time and since Dealerships primarily use overlays on the first image.

## **DEFAULTS**
#### Default file name for inventory file: default-inventory.csv
#### Must contain the following headers: 'Dealer ID', 'Stock Number', 'VIN', 'Images'
